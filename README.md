MSX
===
<br />
MSX, MSX2, MSX2+, &amp; MSX Turbo-R Code by krom (Peter Lemon).<br />
<br />
All code compiles out of box with the bass assembler by byuu.<br />
I use a special version of bass by ARM9 which has been updated with MSX Z80 & MSX Turbo R800 output:<br />
https://github.com/ARM9/bass<br />
I have included binaries of all the demos.<br />
<br />
I used the MSX Assembly Page to help get me started: http://map.grauw.nl/resources/<br />
<br />
Howto Compile:<br />
All the code compiles into a single binary (ROMNAME.rom) file.<br />
Using bass Run: make.bat<br />

I test with the OpenMSX emulator: http://openmsx.org/
